In our project, we use a set of machine learning models trained on a set of sample user data to make predictions regarding what kinds of products customers may be interested in and use prompt engineering to interact with conversational A.I. Specifically, our program works as an assistant for employees to provide better customer service and recommendations. User parameters, gathered through marketing or direct questions, are used as parameters for a feed forward neural network. This network makes predictions about user preferences, which are then displayed to the employee to suggest products. Furthermore, the program generates prompts that could be sent to a chatbot for further information.
